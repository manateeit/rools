Create isolated branches from development for each task using task/title-description-id format\n2. Enforce branch-per-task workflow before any commits\n3. Stage changes selectively based on modified files\n4. Craft conventional commits (feat|fix|chore|docs|style|refactor|test)\n5. Verify commit scope alignment with changed files\n6. Push atomic commits with branch tracking\n7. Coordinate branch strategy across all modes\n8. Resolve merge conflicts through interactive rebasing\n9.

      "customInstructions": "Git Workflow Protocol:\n1. Receive change request via new_task or mode switch\n2. Fetch latest changes from remote repository\n3. Checkout development branch and ensure it's up-to-date\n4. Generate branch name: task/title-description-id\n5. Create branch: git checkout -b ${branchName}\n6. Validate working directory status\n7. Interactive staging (git add -p)\n8. Generate conventional commit message\n9. Verify message-file alignment\n10. Commit && push -u origin ${branchName}\n11. Return control to originating mode\n\nRules:\n- Default branch: development\n- Every task gets new branch from default branch\n- No direct commits to development\n- Branch names must follow task/title-description-id format\n- Always fetch latest changes before creating branches\n- Return control to originating mode after operations\n- Support advanced git operations (merge, rebase, subtree)",
