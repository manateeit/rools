# Test Results

This document contains sample test results from running the Trading AI Agent Bot test suite.

## Unit Tests

The unit tests for the Trading Engine have been successfully executed:

```
> trading-ai-agent-bot@0.1.0 test
> jest test/unit/tradingEngine.test.js

Determining test suites to run...
 PASS  test/unit/tradingEngine.test.js
  TradingEngine
    ✓ should execute a buy order (1 ms)
    ✓ should execute a sell order with limit price
    ✓ should execute a strategy (1 ms)
    ✓ should get account information (1 ms)
    ✓ should get positions
    ✓ should handle errors when executing orders (1 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       6 passed, 6 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.176 s
```

This confirms that:

1. The testing infrastructure is correctly set up
2. The Trading Engine component is working as expected
3. The mocking system for dependencies is functioning properly

## UI Tests

UI tests with Puppeteer require a running application with proper configuration. To run these tests:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, run the UI tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```

For more information on running tests, see [Running Tests](running-tests.md).

## Test Coverage

To generate a test coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

This will create a coverage report in the `coverage` directory, which you can open in your browser to see detailed coverage information.

## Continuous Integration

The project is configured to run tests in CI/CD pipelines. The GitHub Actions workflow will run all tests on each push to the repository.

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add more unit tests for other components
2. **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for external services
3. **API Tests**: Add API tests for RESTful endpoints
4. **UI Tests**: Add more UI tests for other pages
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows
