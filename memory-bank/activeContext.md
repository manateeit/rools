# Trading AI Agent Bot - Active Context

## Current Session Focus
- Completed initial architecture design for the trading AI bot
- Defined detailed component specifications
- Created development roadmap
- Established project documentation

## Current Tasks
- [x] Gather key requirements
- [x] Define high-level system architecture
- [x] Establish component structure
- [x] Plan data flow between components
- [x] Determine technology stack
- [x] Design API integration approach
- [x] Create component specifications
- [x] Develop implementation roadmap
- [x] Set up project documentation

## Key Requirements
- Pluggable LLM architecture to support multiple models
- Focus on trading US stocks and ETFs via Alpaca API
- Basic backtesting metrics (returns, drawdowns, Sharpe ratio)
- Dual interface: CLI and web dashboard
- Deployment on Vercel with Supabase for database and authentication
- Enhanced security with encryption for API keys and role-based access control
- Configurable trading frequency with AI assistance for timing decisions
- Paper trading support
- Asset selection capability

## Architecture Summary
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Core Trading Engine as central orchestrator
- Pluggable LLM Integration Layer
- Comprehensive Alpaca API Client
- Backtesting Engine with performance metrics
- Dual interface (CLI and Web)
- Supabase for data storage and authentication
- Vercel for deployment

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of core components
- Set up project repository with initial structure
- Configure development environment
- Establish Supabase and Vercel infrastructure
- Implement basic authentication and data storage
- Develop initial Alpaca API integration
- Create foundation for LLM integration

## Open Questions
- Which specific LLM models will be initially supported?
- What data sources will be used for market data beyond Alpaca?
- What specific trading strategies will the AI implement?
- How will the system handle market hours vs. after-hours?
