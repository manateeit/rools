| 2025-03-31 | Implement enhanced security | Basic security, Advanced security, Compliance-focused | Protect sensitive API keys and trading data | Requires additional development effort but provides necessary protection for financial data | In Progress |
| 2025-03-31 | Support configurable trading frequency with AI assistance | Fixed frequency, Scheduled trading | Allow AI to determine optimal trading times based on market conditions | Requires more complex decision-making logic but provides greater adaptability | Implemented |
| 2025-03-31 | Use Supabase for authentication | Custom auth, Auth0, Firebase Auth | Integrate with existing Supabase infrastructure | Provides consistent authentication across the application stack | Planned |
| 2025-03-31 | Use Event Emitter pattern for component communication | Direct method calls, Callback functions, Message queue | Enable loose coupling between components with event-driven architecture | Improves modularity and testability while allowing for future extensions | Implemented |
| 2025-03-31 | Implement comprehensive error handling in API clients | Basic error handling, No error handling | Ensure robust operation in face of API failures and rate limits | Increases code complexity but improves reliability and user experience | Implemented |
| 2025-03-31 | Use PostgreSQL JSON capabilities for flexible data storage | Rigid schema, NoSQL database | Store complex nested data while maintaining relational integrity | Balances flexibility and structure while leveraging Supabase capabilities | Implemented |

## Design Decisions

| Date | Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale | Impact | Status |
|------|----------|-------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 2025-03-31 | Use Commander.js for CLI argument parsing | Custom parsing, Yargs | Leverage established library with comprehensive features | Simplifies CLI implementation while providing robust command handling | Implemented |
| 2025-03-31 | Use Express with Next.js for web server | Next.js API routes only, Separate backend | Combine flexibility of Express with Next.js frontend capabilities | Allows for more customization of API endpoints while maintaining Next.js benefits | Implemented |
| 2025-03-31 | Implement encryption for API keys | Plain text storage, Third-party key management | Protect sensitive credentials from unauthorized access | Adds implementation complexity but significantly improves security | Implemented |
| 2025-03-31 | Use Row-Level Security in Supabase | Application-level security, Custom authorization | Enforce data access controls at the database level | Provides robust security guarantees independent of application code | Implemented |

## Technical Debt

| Date | Item | Description | Severity | Plan to Address |
|------|------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 2025-03-31 | Backtesting visualization | Basic backtesting engine implemented without visualization components | Medium | Implement visualization in web interface during next phase |
| 2025-03-31 | Comprehensive testing | Core components implemented without unit and integration tests | High | Add testing framework and tests in next phase |
| 2025-03-31 | Error handling standardization | Error handling implemented but not fully standardized across components | Medium | Create error handling utilities and standardize approach |
| 2025-03-31 | Documentation | Code documentation is minimal and needs improvement | Medium | Add comprehensive JSDoc comments and generate API documentation |
