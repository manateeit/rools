# Trading AI Agent Bot - Product Context

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a trading AI agent bot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to make trading decisions. The bot will integrate with the Alpaca API for executing trades, support user-selected assets, provide paper trading capabilities, and include backtesting functionality.

## Memory Bank Structure
The Memory Bank consists of the following core files:

1. **productContext.md** (this file): Contains the overall project context, goals, requirements, and Memory Bank structure.
2. **activeContext.md**: Tracks the current session context, ongoing tasks, and immediate focus areas.
3. **progress.md**: Documents the project's progress, completed milestones, and upcoming work.
4. **decisionLog.md**: Records key architectural and design decisions, including rationales.

## Core Requirements
1. Integration with LLM models (configurable)
2. Alpaca API integration for trading
3. Asset selection capability
4. Paper trading support
5. Backtesting functionality
