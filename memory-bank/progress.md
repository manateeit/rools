## Notes
- Core components have been implemented with a focus on modularity and extensibility
- The system uses a pluggable architecture for LLM models, allowing for flexibility in model selection
- The CLI interface provides a comprehensive set of commands for trading, market data, and configuration
- The web server exposes RESTful APIs for the web interface to interact with the core components
- The backtesting engine simulates trading strategies on historical data with performance metrics
- The database schema includes tables for users, API keys, trades, backtests, model performance, and strategy executions
- The web interface implementation is complete with all major pages and components:
  - Dashboard for monitoring portfolio performance and market overview
  - Trading page for executing trades and strategies
  - Backtesting page for evaluating trading strategies
  - Settings page for configuring user preferences, API keys, notifications, and LLM models
- Next steps will focus on implementing the API routes, authentication integration, and deployment configuration
