## Notes
- Core components have been implemented with a focus on modularity and extensibility
- The system uses a pluggable architecture for LLM models, allowing for flexibility in model selection
- The CLI interface provides a comprehensive set of commands for trading, market data, and configuration
- The web server exposes RESTful APIs for the web interface to interact with the core components
- The backtesting engine simulates trading strategies on historical data with performance metrics
- The database schema includes tables for users, API keys, trades, backtests, model performance, and strategy executions
- The web interface implementation is complete with all major pages and components:
  - Dashboard for monitoring portfolio performance and market overview
  - Trading page for executing trades and strategies
  - Backtesting page for evaluating trading strategies
  - Settings page for configuring user preferences, API keys, notifications, and LLM models
- API routes for authentication and user management have been implemented:
  - Authentication routes for login, signup, and logout
  - User profile and preferences management
  - API key management with encryption
  - Notification settings configuration
  - LLM model settings configuration
- API routes for trading have been implemented:
  - Assets route for listing available assets
  - Market data route for getting price data
  - Account route for getting account information
  - Positions route for managing positions
  - Orders routes for creating and managing orders
  - Trades route for listing executed trades
  - Strategy route for executing trading strategies with different algorithms
- API routes for backtesting have been implemented:
  - Run backtest route for executing backtests with different strategies
  - List backtests route for retrieving backtest history with filtering and sorting
  - Get/delete backtest route for managing individual backtests
- Next steps will focus on authentication integration and deployment configuration
